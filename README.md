Foxer
=====


Create, use and organize Firefox and Chrome profiles. 
Usage:

```foxer NAME URL```

will create a profile of NAME, under the
${GLOBAL_PROFILES}/${NAME}${SUFFIX} ($HOME/profiles/browers by default) path.
SUFFIX is -ff for foxer and -gc for chrome. Or use profile of this NAME.
And open browser on URL (read more about those urls as it can send a lot of them).

Why?
====

You can have one profile, with tools, bookmarks, browsing history,
all related to your job. 

One profile for browsing stuff. 
Another for big Project X. 

All your data, settings, cookies, preserved logins
reduced neatly to one folder.  

All your work related urls reduced to one script.

Minus
=====

!!! ALWAYS BACKUP YOUR PROFILES !!!

A profile is often related to browser version.
To read it, you need browser with proper version.

It is adviced to download the browser archive and keep it some where.
